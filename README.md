# vimStartupFile

We extensively use vim for editing all the time , and there are so many custom parameters that have to be included all the time, to make the most out of vim.
Instead of setting these parameters all the time, we can set them once in the home directory and vim will support them in all terminals.

vim startup file has to be created to include great vim feature by default :
We want to put it in our home directory, so you have to save it as ~/.vimrc  >> Linux MacOS
Do the same to file _vimrc in window terminal home directory.

On Linux if the vim config file is not created by default, then create one.
